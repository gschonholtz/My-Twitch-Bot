its just a discord bot that notifies you when your favorite streamer(s) play your favorite game(s)

itll save your preferences in a config file, so if you dont want to deal with shitty UI or just copy paste go in that folder and
skip straight to twitch!notifs

otherwise, run twitch!setstreamer for some introductory text that tells you what to do.
interact with the buttons BEFORE you run twitch!notifs, shit breaks when you do after

figure out how to use these files youreself in your own bot because i sure as hell dont know how to actually use this efficiently outside of replit which i used in the introductory cs class i made this in
